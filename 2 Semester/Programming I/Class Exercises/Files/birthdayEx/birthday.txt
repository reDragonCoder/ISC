Anastasia: Tomorrow is Raul?s birthday. 
Rebecca: Isn?t it next week? 
Anastasia: No, I looked at his Facebook profile and confirmed that it is 
tomorrow. 
Rebecca: We must do something to celebrate his birthday. 
Anastasia: Yes. How about a surprise party on Friday? 
Rebecca: Great idea. What time? 
Anastasia: I think at 7 pm it is fine. 
Rebecca: I think it is too early, how about at 9? 
Anastasia: OK. But I have to work early on Saturday, so I can?t stay for 
the whole party. 
Rebecca: No problem. And whom should we invite? 
Anastasia: Well, his wife and his parents. 
Rebecca: We should also invite his friends from work. 
Anastasia: Sure, where is the party? 
Rebecca: Well, it will be in your house, right? 
Anastasia: I do not know. I should ask John first. 
Rebecca: OK. Let me know as soon as possible to start organizing 
everything.
