Bitcoin, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, is the first cryptocurrency that enables peer-to-peer 
transactions without intermediaries. With a capped supply of 21 million coins, it operates on a deflationary model, 
attracting both investors and speculators.
Powered by blockchain technology, Bitcoin ensures secure and transparent transactions. Despite facing regulatory scrutiny 
and environmental concerns, its growing acceptance by businesses and individuals underscores its potential to reshape the 
financial landscape.
As a symbol of decentralized finance, Bitcoin continues to influence how we think about money and investment in the digital 
age.
